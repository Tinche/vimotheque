Playbook composability?
=======================
Ideally, users should be able to define a general purpose playbook, and have
more specific playbooks include the general purpose one. Also, users should be
able to run vtq on several specific playbooks at once:

vtq python.yml ruby.yml web.yml js.yml

Explore what idempotency means in this context - when is a cleanup required?
Always, when a user requests it, or use clever logic?

Better wrapper script.
